## Partify
#### Put the power of the party in the palm of your hand.


### Description

Partify is an app that allows you to use you and your friends' music tastes to create a custom tailored playlist for any occasion.  The app currently allows you to select between Party, Chill, and Discover for a party that suits your current needs.

### Rundown

The first screen asks for you to login which will take you to a spotify login page.  Once you login and accept permissions you should have access to our site!  Here are the steps for creating your first Partify playlist:
- Enter a playlist name and click submit
- Get your friends username and click create playlist or add more users.  Their names and profile photos should show up.  You can also change your type of playlist from the highly popular and danceable, Party setting to the low energy, chill setting and the hidden gems of the discover setting
- Once your playlist is created the playlist name and image should show up and clicking it will redirect you to the playlist!
